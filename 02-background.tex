\jbs{tentative citation list:}
\begin{itemize}
\item ILP focussed I-Cache~\cite{yeh93}
\item Future GPUs~\cite{keckler11} \jbs{Someone needs to read parts
  of this. Table 3 shows how they expect instruction caches to be
  arranged. \url{http://www.davidglasco.com/Papers/ieee-micro.pdf}}
\item Old paper on I-Cache policies~\cite{smith85} \jbs{Someone should
  skim this if possible.}
\item Another old paper~\cite{smith83} \jbs{same authors as
  above. Probably much of the same. Again skim only}
\item ISPC~\cite{pharr12} \jbs{A SPMD compiler, but has intersting
