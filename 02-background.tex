\section{Background}

Instruction cache can have a large impact in a processor's
performance. 
There have been lot of work in the past in improving the performance
of instruction cache  CPUs. 
Techniques such as advanced branch prediction~\cite{yeh93} and
replacement policies~\cite{smith85} have contributed to the high
performance of instruction cache in modern CPUs. 
It has even been shown that system performance can increase by 10-20\%
just by adjusting the operating system to use the instruction cache
efficiently~\cite{torrellas98}.
While all of these approaches are useful, the future of computing
includes very large numbers of independent processor cores integrated
on one chip.
While general purpose CPUs are likely to include hundreds of cores at
some point in the future, a good example to consider today is the GPU,
which already exposes hundreds to thousands of threads to the
programmer. 

Modern GPUs are designed to have several
compute units to maximize throughput, and to expose these compute
units for general purpose computation instead of only graphics
applications.
These compute units are compact, and designed to perform simple
operations on a large set of data. 
It is not feasible to implement techniques such as advanced branch
prediction on these small compute units, because a single GPU unit
can have up to a couple hundred of these compute units. 
To improve the instruction cache performance of GPUs, new solutions
need to be developed in ways that maintain the compact and simplistic
nature of the compute units. 
Current GPU architectures are designed with individual L1 instruction
cache for each compute unit of the GPU\cite{keckler11}. 
It may be possible to have multiple compute units share the same
instruction cache without incurring serious performance or power
penalties.
