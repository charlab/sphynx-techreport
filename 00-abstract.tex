The Sphynx project was an exploratory study to discover what might be
done to improve the heavy replication of instructions in independent
instruction caches for a massively parallel machine where a single
program is executing across all of the cores. 
It is expected that a large amount of sharing should be possible when
the independent threads all issue from the same instruction pool.
Ideally a large amount of sharing should be possible, where a single
instruction cache can be shared among $N$ threads, where $N\geq 2$.
