The Sphynx project was an exploratory study to discover what might be
done to improve the heavy replication of instructions in independent
instruction caches for a massively parallel machine where a single
program is executing across all of the cores. 
While a machine with only many cores (fewer than 50) might not have
any issues replecating the instructions for each core, as we approach
the era where thousands of cores can be placed on one chip, the
overhead of instruction replecation may become unacceptably large.
We believe that a large amount of sharing should be possible when the
machine is configured for all of the threads to issue from the same
set of instructions.
We propose a technique that allows sharing an instruction cache among
a number of independent processor cores to allow for inter-thread
sharing and reuse of instruction memory.
While we do not have test cases to demonstrate the potential magnitude
of performance gains that could be achieved, the potential for sharing
reduces the die area required for instruction storage on chip.
