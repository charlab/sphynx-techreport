\section{Shared Instruction Cache Design}
\jbs{Akhil in charge.}

The architectural design associated with moden GPU's is one in which each core in the GPU has access to its own instruction cache. Reducing the number of instruction caches for the same number of cores in a streaming multiprocessor has certain advantages. First, using a shared instruction cache design we could reduce the number of compulsory misses because an instruction previously executed by one streaming multiprocessor may be available for another streaming multiprocessor immediately rather than requiring an additional miss. We hypothesized that sharing an instruction cache would result in increased efficiency and fewer cache misses. Figure \ref{fig:propDesign} shows the current design explaining the interaction between GPUs and instruction caches, the proposed design of sharing an instruction cache over multiple (but not all) cores in the streaming multiporocessor and the last design ennumerates the proposed design of a \emph{single} instruction cache to be shared by all the cores on the steaming multiprocessor.
