Most computer architectures build an independent instruction cache for
each processing core as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:indep}.
Reducing the number of instruction caches for the same number of cores
in a multi-core processor may have certain advantages. 
First, a shared instruction cache design could reduce the amount of
storage and die area required to hold instructions on chip when
multiple processors are executing the same program.
This advantage in storage and area could result in reduced performance
if the pressure to this shared resource becomes too high.
Similarly, the benefits of reduced cache size will not be realized in
multi-program workloads, unless the operating system is able to
discover shared library code and perform the proper virtual mapping to
allow the hardware to exploit it.
Second, a shared instruction cache design could reduce the number of
compulsory misses because an instruction previously fetched
by one processor may be available for another processor immediately
rather than requiring an additional cache miss. 
Again, this benefit is only relevant for single-application parallel
workloads.

The first approach to shared instruction caches would be to couple an
instruction cache with a pair of processors as in
Figure~\ref{fig:paired}. 
This would require a small amount of routing overhead and allow for the
operating system or programmer to intelligently schedule two threads 
that share instructions to these two processor cores in order to exploit 
the shared instruction cache.
While sharing an instruction between two cores is one step towards shared
caches, at its limit, a chip could be designed to share a single instruction
cache among all processors on chip, shown with an example of only four
processors in Figure~\ref{fig:shared}.
For an arbitrary number of cores, the level of sharing could be
scaled up or down to fit the applications and purpose of the
architecture design.
One could even imagine a design where assymetrical sharing is enabled
by grouping different sets of compute cores differently and then
assigning the application threads to the appropriate cores to match
the sharing to the hardware available.

While our proposed technique is likely only beneficial in situations
with highly parallel programs, it is probable that future systems will
often run a few highly parallel workloads that can benefit from these
advantages. 
A hybrid approach would allow some cores to efficiently process general 
purpose applications while cores with shared instruction caches execute
parallel single program workloads.
When different threads within a parallel application diverge in program flow,
it may be useful to further design the instruction caches to have multiple
independent banks that can be accessed in parallel.
We believe the multi-banked approach to be the most beneficial, however we do not 
present results or analysis of multi-banked caches in this work.
